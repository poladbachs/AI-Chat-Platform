# AI Sales & Customer Engagement Chatbot

## Overview
The **AI Sales & Customer Engagement Chatbot** is a demo multi-turn conversational agent built for sales automation. Tailored for [**navAI**](https://navai.ch) company, this chatbot dynamically engages users, qualifies leads, and guides them to relevant website sections via clickable links. It combines structured business responses with AI-generated fallback using DialoGPT and uses NLP-based intent detection for context-aware replies.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Conversation:**  
  A hybrid solution that combines predefined structured responses with AI-generated replies to handle both targeted sales queries and casual small talk.
- **Intent Detection:**  
  Utilizes Spacy vector similarity to understand diverse phrasings and accurately detect sales intents (e.g., pricing, features, demo, contact).
- **Clickable Responses:**  
  Provides immediate responses with links directing users to relevant navAI modules (Solutions, Process, Contact).
- **Lead Qualification:**  
  Implements a lead scoring mechanism that measures buyer intent through keyword analysis, enhancing conversion potential.
- **Flask API & Streamlit UI:**  
  Integrated via a Flask API and showcased through an elegant, interactive Streamlit dashboard for live demonstrations.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. **User Query Processing:**  
   The chatbot preprocesses the user input (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase) and applies NLP-based intent detection.
2. **Structured Response Generation:**  
   If a business intent (e.g., "pricing") is detected, the bot returns a predefined response with clickable links referencing navAI website modules.
3. **Fallback to Conversational AI:**  
   For general or casual queries, DialoGPT generates natural responses, ensuring a smooth and engaging conversation.
4. **Lead Qualification:**  
   The system counts sales-related keywords to assign a lead score, providing a metric of buyer interest.
